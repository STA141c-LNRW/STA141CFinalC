Description: This R package provides functions for fitting linear regression models on 
  datasets with continuous response variables through the use of Bag of Little Bootstraps. 
  Users can determine regression coefficients, estimate the variance of errors, and predict 
  new data. Users also have the option to use parallel computing.
