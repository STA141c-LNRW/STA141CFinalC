Final Project for STA 141C at UC Davis, Winter 2020

William Shih, Ricardo Simpao, Nilay Varshney, Luke Yee

This R package provides functions for fitting linear regression models on datasets with continuous response variables through the use of Bag of Little Bootstraps. Users can determine regression coefficients, estimate the variance of errors, and predict new data. Users also have the option to use parallel computing.

The dataset used in the user guide can be found at the link below. Note that the three rightmost columns are to be disregarded as the dataset has four response variables.
